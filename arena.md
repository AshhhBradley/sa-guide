# Mob Arena
The mob arena is a Player vs Environment mini-game on the server which you can join using the `/ma join <arena>` command. This involves beating waves of mobs up to a total of 30 times until you reach the boss. Multiple players can join the arena, up to 4 can join the mansion arena which is the free to play arena. Up to 10 players can join the mountain arena which costs 100,000 in game money to begin.

When an arena is about to begin there will be an announcement in chat to join. Upon joining you will have a brief moment to select a class. For the mountain arena you can use your own items however for the mansion arena you will be required to select a class. For this the gunslinger class is highly recommended.

# Chest Shops
A more detailed guide can be found here: [Chest Shop Wiki](https://github.com/TheClowner/ccshop-support/wiki)
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }

## Getting Started
These shops are mostly GUI based.

Creating a chest shop to sell items is quite simple. 

1. Place a chest and a sign on that chest. Then type [shop] on the first line.
2. Right click the sign and click the nether star to add a default item \(dirt block).
3. Click the default item and drag the item you want to sell into the first slot.
4. Now you can click the gold ingot to set a price.
5. Click the redstone dust labelled enable selling if it isn't already enabled.
6. You can now close this menu and click the sign in the top left to edit the shop text.
7. Finally click the redstone dust in the top left and this will open the shop and make it accessible to other players.

There are faster methods but this is what I found to be most user friendly for beginners so I recommend checking the wiki for that.

Also worth noting that these shops can be made with chests, barrels and shulker boxes.

### Adding other players
You can allow a total of 5 other players access to restock your shops. All profits will still only go to the chest shop owner.
- Right click shop sign > Manage Trusted Players > Add Trusted Player > Click the chat message > Add their name to the end of the command

### Adding more containers
You can link a total of three containers to a chest shop.
- Right click shop sign > Click the chest icon > Now right click any container you want to add

These containers have a limited range from where the sign is placed.

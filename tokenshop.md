## How to earn tokens
- Tokens can be earned through various ways one of the easiest ways is by voting for each vote you will receive 2 tokens and you can vote up to 5 times each day. Check `/vote` for this.

- Voting will also give you vote crates which has a high chance of giving various amounts of tokens from 5 to 100 depending how lucky you get. Check `/pw crates` for this.

- Token crates are also a great way to earn tokens, these will sometimes be given as rewards or you can get them by supporting the server. Check `/store` for this.

- When the server reaches a certain amount of players online there will be a broadcast in chat from chatty. You can earn a token from this by either unscrambling or typing the word it broadcasts.\
See [Misc]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link misc.md %}#chatty) for more details.

- Mob arena is another way to earn tokens, from this you can earn 15 tokens upon completion. This can be quite challenging and time consuming as it requires all 30 waves to be beaten.\
See [Mob Arena]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link arena.md %}) for more details.

TLDR; voting, crates, chatty & mob arena.

## Artifacts
These are custom items which can be placed in the players offhand to give different effects.\
Some of these effects include: Speed, Knockback, Strength, Luck & others.

## Mob Spawners
Mob spawners are available to anyone but they require a Spawner Breaking Pickaxe which is a one time use pickaxe that will break as soon as it is used. This pickaxe can be purchases for 120 tokens or won through crates. There is also an hourly limit on how many spawners can be broken per player.

You can change a spawner type by right clicking it with a mob spawn egg. These mob spawn eggs can also be purchased through the token shop for various amounts.

## Chunk Hoppers
Chunk hoppers will make your farms on the server so much easier to make, no more need for hopper minecarts and rails. These hoppers will suck up all items broken from pistons or players and even items dropped by droppers within the chunk they are placed in. They also ignore any item the player drops. You can use the keyboard shortcut F3 + G to see chunk borders.

Shift clicking a chunk hopper will allow you to add a filter. You can drag and drop an item into the filter inventory and it'll make a copy of that item. This will make it so it only picks up the items placed into the filter. Perfect for pumpkin and melon farms.

## Shulker Backpacks
This is a game changing perk which can be purchased for 300 tokens. Sponsor rank includes this perk. It allows you to shift + right click any shulker in your inventory to open it without the need to place it which makes inventory management a much nicer experience.

## Enderchest Expansion
For those with the `/ec` command this is a great upgrade to purchase. With this you can expand your enderchest up to three times to add three additional rows of inventory space. You can win this perk through vote crates as one of the rare rewards.

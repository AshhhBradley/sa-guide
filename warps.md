# Player Warps
Player warps are a great way to show off your builds, make a public shop or even just for a public area projects. You can use the command `/warps` or `/pw` to view the warps menu.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
From here you can also create a new warp by clicking the Lapis icon then hover over the Heart of the Sea to check how many warp points you have. If you have none you can either get one through a vote crate or purchase one for 100,000 in game money by clicking the Lapis beside the Heart of the Sea.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Once you have a warp point and want to make a new warp, first check the name you want isn't already taken. You can do this by typing the name of the warp you want using `/pw <warp name>`, if the name is not already taken a chat message will display telling you whether it exists or not. If you don't do this and the name is already taken you'll lose the warp point.

After doing this return to the My Warps menu with the the Heart of the Sea and click it, you'll then be prompted to type the name you want.
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
Now you can edit your warp by selecting it in the My Warps menu.\
This allows you to do various things including:
{: .fs-5 .fw-300 }
- Set location
- Change the warp name
- Edit the warp description
- Change the warp icon to either an item or a players head
- Change the warp type to show up in different categories
- You can also toggle maintenance mode which will disable other players being able to use the warp

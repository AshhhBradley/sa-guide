# Skills & Abilities
Skills are quite straight forward. As you play survival you'll level up your skills over time through various different ways. Once one of your skills reaches a high enough level you'll be able to use a mana ability such as the mining ability which will allow you to speed mine for a short period of time.

If one of your mana abilities requires more mana than you currently have, you'll want to level up and skills which increase Wisdom.

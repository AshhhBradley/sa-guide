### Griefing
This goes hand in hand with rule 12 if you're reported for destroying or stealing from unclaimed player built areas and requires a rollback you'll most likely receive a ban and have items taken from you.

---

### Advertising
This includes but it not limited to invites to personal discords, other Minecraft servers, YouTube channels etc., these all need to stay out of main chat.

---

### Excessive Cursing
The occasional curse word will be accepted but if staff thinks it's becoming too much you'll be asked to stop and if this request is ignored it can result in a server mute.

---

### English is the main chat language
As staff we need to be able to understand chat to be able to moderate it. You can use `/msg` or `/g gc` for other languages.

---

### Warp Rules
You are not allowed to make a warp that traps people, contains NSFW content or misleads other players.
